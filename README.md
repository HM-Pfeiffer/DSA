# DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) 📚

Welcome to the **DSA** repository! This repository is dedicated to solving various LeetCode challenges using different data structures and algorithms. It is linked with **LeetSync** 🔄 for seamless synchronization between LeetCode and GitHub, allowing for an organized and up-to-date collection of solutions.

## Features ✨

* **LeetCode Solutions** 💻: The repository contains solutions to a variety of LeetCode problems, ranging from easy to more complex algorithmic challenges. The solutions are written in different programming languages, including but not limited to **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.

* **LeetSync Integration** 🔄: This repository is integrated with **LeetSync**, allowing you to sync your LeetCode progress with GitHub. This means that solutions are always up-to-date, and you can track your problem-solving journey easily.

* **Organized Problem Structure** 📂: Each solution is stored in an organized manner, typically by the problem number or name. This makes it easy to navigate the repository and find specific solutions to problems.

* **Continuous Updates** 🔄: The repository will be continuously updated with new solutions as challenges are completed. This ensures that the collection remains relevant and growing as new LeetCode problems are solved.

## Repository Structure 🗂️

* Each problem has its own directory or file containing the solution code.
* The problem directories are named logically, typically by their LeetCode problem number or title, making it easy to locate specific challenges.

## Why This Repository Exists 🤔

The main goal of this repository is to create a structured and easily accessible collection of LeetCode solutions. It serves as a personal reference for solving algorithmic challenges and is shared publicly to benefit others who may be tackling similar problems. The integration with **LeetSync** makes it easier to stay consistent with problem-solving progress and ensures that solutions remain aligned with LeetCode's platform.
